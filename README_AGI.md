## Usage

### Basic Example

```python
from agi_system import AGI

# Create an AGI instance
agi = AGI(name="MyAGI")

# Process input and get intelligent response
response = agi.think("What is the capital of France?")
print(response['response'])
print(f"Confidence: {response['confidence']}")

# Set a goal
agi.set_goal("Improve mathematical reasoning", priority=8)

# Solve a problem
problem = {
    "description": "Find the next number in sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ?",
    "type": "pattern_recognition"
}
solution = agi.solve_problem(problem)
print(f"Solution: {solution['solution']}")
```

### Running the Demo

```bash
python demo_agi.py

## Key Components Explained

### 1. AGI Core (`agi.py`)

The main orchestrator that coordinates all cognitive modules. It implements:
- The main cognitive loop (`think()` method)
- Problem-solving coordination
- Self-improvement cycles
- Performance tracking

### 2. Reasoning Agent

Implements multiple reasoning methods:
- **Deductive**: Drawing specific conclusions from general premises
- **Inductive**: Generalizing from specific examples
- **Abductive**: Finding the best explanation for observations
- **Analogical**: Reasoning based on similarities

### 3. Learning Agent

Handles all learning aspects:
- Stores and learns from experiences
- Identifies patterns in data
- Implements meta-learning to improve learning efficiency
- Tracks skill improvements over time

### 4. Planning Agent

Creates and optimizes plans:
- Decomposes complex goals into sub-goals
- Selects appropriate planning strategies
- Optimizes plan execution
- Handles constraints and resources

### 5. Memory System

Sophisticated memory management:
- Working memory with limited capacity
- Long-term storage with consolidation
- Context-aware retrieval
- Forgetting mechanisms for efficiency

### 6. Knowledge Base

Structured knowledge representation:
- Facts as semantic triples
- Inference rules for deriving new knowledge
- Domain-specific knowledge organization
- Query and explanation capabilities

## Educational Value

This implementation demonstrates:

1. **System Architecture**: How different cognitive modules can work together
2. **Reasoning Methods**: Various approaches to logical thinking
3. **Learning Mechanisms**: How systems can improve from experience
4. **Memory Organization**: Efficient storage and retrieval of information
5. **Knowledge Representation**: Structured ways to store and use knowledge
6. **Planning Strategies**: Different approaches to achieving goals
7. **Self-Improvement**: How systems can identify and address weaknesses

## Limitations

This is an educational implementation and has several limitations:

1. **Simplified Algorithms**: Uses simplified versions of complex algorithms
2. **No Neural Networks**: Doesn't use deep learning (for clarity)
3. **Limited Scalability**: Designed for demonstration, not production
4. **Deterministic Elements**: Some random elements for variety
5. **No Real Understanding**: Simulates understanding through algorithms

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for expansion:
- Integration with neural networks
- Natural language processing
- Computer vision capabilities

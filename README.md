This is a test repository for the Fern Labs AI agent.

## AGI System

This repository now contains an educational implementation of an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) system! 

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run the AGI demonstration
python demo_agi.py
```

### What's Included

- **Complete AGI Architecture**: A modular system demonstrating key AGI concepts
- **Multiple Cognitive Agents**: Reasoning, learning, and planning capabilities
- **Memory & Knowledge Systems**: Short/long-term memory and structured knowledge base
- **Task Environment**: Various challenges to test the AGI
- **Self-Improvement**: Mechanisms for the system to identify and improve weaknesses

See [README_AGI.md](README_AGI.md) for detailed documentation.

### Example Usage

```python
from agi_system import AGI

# Create an AGI instance
agi = AGI(name="DemoAGI")

# Let it think!
response = agi.think("How can I solve complex problems?")
print(response['response'])
```

This is an educational implementation to demonstrate AGI concepts - not actual AGI (which remains an open research challenge).
